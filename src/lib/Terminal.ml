(* There are many kinds of consoles a.k.a terminals.
 * Under Unix: xterm, rxvt, Gnome Terminal, ... and the raw Linux ttys
 * They all understand ANSI escape sequences (e.g., ANSI colors).
 * They are ANSI compliant.
 * Under macOS: default terminal, iTerm, ...
 * also ANSI compliant.
 * Under Windows:
 *  - Command prompt (available by default)
 *  - Windows Powershell (by default)
 *  - Console host conhost.exe (by default)
 *  - Windows terminal (not by default!), must be installed here
 *    https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&hl=es-es&gl=ES
 *  - Visual studio code integrated terminal (part of VScode)
 *  - Cygwin terminal (not by default, and different world)
 * Only the last three are ANSI compliant by default.
 * See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51680709/colored-text-output-in-powershell-console-using-ansi-vt100-codes
 *
 * There are also many OCaml libraries to handle formatting in the terminal:
 *  - ANSITerminal
 *  - Fmt
 *  - ocolor
 *  - lambda-term
 *  - ocaml-spectrum
 * You can also write the ANSI codes yourself in a string.
